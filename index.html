    <h2>Strengths and Professional Goals</h2>
    <p>Completing the coursework and developing the ePortfolio has significantly shaped my professional goals and values. The ePortfolio has helped me identify my strengths in software development, algorithms, data structures, and database management. These areas are crucial for my career aspirations as a cybersecurity analyst.</p>

    <h3 id="collaborating-in-team">Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
    <p>Throughout the program, I have engaged in numerous team projects that required effective collaboration and communication. For instance, in the CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance course, I worked closely with my peers to develop automated testing scripts. This experience honed my ability to collaborate in a team environment, share responsibilities, and integrate feedback to improve the final product.</p>

    <h3 id="communicating-with-stakeholders">Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>Effective communication with stakeholders is vital in any software development project. In IT315: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, I learned to gather requirements, document system specifications, and present designs to stakeholders. This course emphasized the importance of clear and concise communication, which I applied in my final project by documenting enhancements and explaining technical details in an understandable manner.</p>

    <h3 id="data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>My understanding of data structures and algorithms has been deepened through courses like CS260: Data Structures and Algorithms. I applied this knowledge in my second milestone by optimizing the search functionality using binary search and implementing efficient sorting and filtering algorithms. These enhancements showcase my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms to solve complex problems.</p>

    <h3 id="software-engineering-database">Software Engineering and Database</h3>
    <p>The CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course provided practical experience in software design and database management. For my final project, I enhanced an inventory management application by integrating Firebase Firestore, implementing complex SQL queries, and ensuring data security through encryption. These enhancements demonstrate my proficiency in software engineering and database management.</p>

    <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
    <p>Developing a security mindset has been a critical part of my learning. In CS405: Secure Coding, I learned to anticipate adversarial exploits and design software with security in mind. This knowledge was applied in my final project by encrypting user credentials and ensuring secure data storage in Firebase Firestore.</p>

<section id="capstone-project">
    <h2>Capstone Project CS 499</h2>
    <p>The selected artifact for the enhancement for this Project is the Inventory Management Application. This application was developed for the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in September 2023 using Android Studio. The app is designed to enhance inventory management in warehouse environments by providing features such as user authentication, inventory display, item addition and removal, quantity adjustment, and low inventory notifications. The project was inspired by personal experiences in a warehouse setting, where a need for a more efficient inventory management system was identified. The enhancement for the artifact for all three categories, i.e., Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Database, reflect the comprehensive skill set I have developed throughout the program.</p>
