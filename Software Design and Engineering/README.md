# Software Design and Engineering Artifact
Inventory Management Application

## Description and Origin
The Inventory Management Application was initially developed for the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in September 2023. The app streamlines inventory management in warehouse environments by providing features such as user authentication, inventory display, item addition and removal, quantity adjustment, and low inventory notifications.

## Justification
This artifact was chosen for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates key skills and abilities in software development, particularly in software design and user interface design. The enhancements included implementing Singleton and MVC patterns, redesigning the user interface to follow Material Design guidelines, and adding functionalities for PDF report generation and barcode scanning.

## Enhancements
Implemented Singleton and MVC patterns in the `DataController` and `DatabaseHelper` classes to improve code maintainability and readability. Redesigned the user interface in `data_display_screen.xml` to follow Material Design guidelines, enhancing the user experience. Added PDF report generation functionality in `DataController` to create inventory reports and barcode scanning capabilities in `BarcodeScannerActivity` to facilitate quick item lookup.

## Learning and Challenges
The process of enhancing this artifact provided valuable learning experiences. Implementing design patterns required a deeper understanding of software architecture. Redesigning the user interface enhanced my skills in UI/UX design, while adding advanced functionalities expanded my knowledge of integrating third-party libraries and services. Challenges included managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility with existing project structures.
