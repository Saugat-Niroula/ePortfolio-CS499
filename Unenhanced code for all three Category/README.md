# Inventory Management Application

## Description and Origin
The Inventory Management Application was initially developed for the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in September 2023. The app streamlines inventory management in warehouse environments by providing features such as user authentication, inventory display, item addition and removal, quantity adjustment, and low inventory notifications.

## Enhancement Goals
The primary goal of the enhancements was to elevate the functionality, efficiency, and security of the Inventory Management Application. By integrating advanced software design principles, optimizing algorithms, and enhancing database operations, the project aimed to demonstrate a comprehensive application of skills acquired throughout the Computer Science program. Detailed goals included implementing Singleton and MVC patterns for better software architecture, optimizing data retrieval and processing through advanced algorithms, and ensuring robust data security through encryption and secure database integration. For more details, you can refer to my enhancement plan document.
