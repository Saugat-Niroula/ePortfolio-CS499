# Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact
Inventory Management Application

## Description and Origin
The Inventory Management Application was initially developed for the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in September 2023. The app streamlines inventory management in warehouse environments by providing features such as user authentication, inventory display, item addition and removal, quantity adjustment, and low inventory notifications.

## Justification
This artifact was chosen for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates key skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures. The enhancements included optimizing data retrieval, implementing a balanced binary search tree and hash map for efficient data storage and retrieval, and adding advanced sorting and filtering functionalities.

## Enhancements
Optimized data retrieval by implementing indexing on frequently queried columns and using in-memory caching for frequently accessed data. Implemented a balanced binary search tree in the `DataController` class for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Added sorting functionalities in `sortItems` method and filtering options in `filterItemsByQuantity` method to improve usability.

## Learning and Challenges
Enhancing this artifact involved understanding advanced data structures and their practical applications. Implementing indexing and in-memory caching required a deeper understanding of database optimization techniques. Integrating a balanced binary search tree expanded my knowledge of algorithmic principles. Challenges included ensuring data consistency and managing efficient memory usage.
